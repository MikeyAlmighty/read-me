#+TITLE: Diamond Dependency Conflict

Diamond dependency conflicts are particularly difficult to solve because the changes required to solve them canâ€™t be made by either the root of the dependency tree (here, A) or the common library in conflict (here, D); the updates need to be made in one or more intervening libraries (here, B). At the same time, the library that needs updates (library B) has no incentive to make the change. Consequently, diamond dependency conflicts must be solved at an ecosystem level instead of purely at the local level.
