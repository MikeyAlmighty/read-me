Sets = Like lists, except only unique values.
Considered as unsorted
Dynamic

If a Set supports:

 - Insert an element
 - Delete an element
 - Test a membership (I.e test does there exist a value in the set)

We call them dictionaries.

Operations on a set:
 - Querying (Giving information about the set)
 - Modifiying (Changes the element in the set)
