#+TITLE:The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

 1. Avoid Complex Flow Constructs (GOTO/Recursion)
 2. All loops must have fixed bounds. (Prevents runaway code)
 3. Avoid heap memory allocation.
 4. Restrict functions to a single printed page.
 5. Use a minimum of 2 runtime assertions per function.
 6. Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
 7. Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.
 8. Use the preprocessor sparingly.
 9. Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.
 10. Compile with all possible warnings active.
