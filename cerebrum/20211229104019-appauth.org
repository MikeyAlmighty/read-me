#+title: AppAuth

*AppAuth* is a client SDK for native apps to authenticate and authorize end-users using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

[[id:c88cbd0e-df59-4de9-9452-1faeb074d7ac][OAuth2.0]] authorization requests from native apps should *only* be made through external [[id:65d45b24-3618-41f6-98a8-a3a65389ef48][user-agents]], primarily the user's *browser*.
This specification details the security and usability reasons why this is the case and how native apps and authorization servers can implement this best practice.

It follows the best practices set out in RFC 8252 - OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps including using in-app browser tabs (like `SFAuthenticationSession` and `Android Custom Tabs`) where available.

*Embedded [[id:65d45b24-3618-41f6-98a8-a3a65389ef48][user-agents]] (known as web-views)* are explicitly not supported due to the usability and security reasons.
