#+title: Proof Key for Code Exchange

When the native application first loads the login page in the browser, it also generates a `code_verifier` string and passes that as a parameter on the URL.
The Authorization Server stores away this string before returning the code back to the native application.
When the native application then exchanges the code for the access token, it will include the `code_verifier` string on that call.
If the `code_verifier` is missing or doesnâ€™t match the previously recorded one, the Authorization Server will *not* return the access token.
