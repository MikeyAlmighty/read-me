* Structural Diagrams (Show different objects in the modeled system).
- Composite Structure Diagram (Show internal structure of a class).
- Deployment Diagram
- Package Diagram (Shows dependencies between different packages).
- Profile Diagram
- Class Diagram (Shows classes in the system , attributes and operations of each class and the [[id:68ff5d2a-921d-4035-acfc-194ccbb9c7a1][relationship between each class]]).
- Object Diagram
- Component Diagram

* Behavioral  Diagrams (Describes how the objects interact with each other).
- Activity Diagram (Represents workflows (Business/operational)).
- Use Case Diagram (Graphic overview of actors involved in a system, different functions needed by said actors).
- State Machine Diagram
- Interaction Diagram
- Sequence Diagram (Represents how objects interact with each other and the order those interactions occur).
- Communication Diagram (Similar to sequence diagrams, but the focus is on messages passed between objects).
- Interview Overview Diagram
- Timing Diagram
