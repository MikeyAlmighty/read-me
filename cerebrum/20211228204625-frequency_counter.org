#+title: Frequency-Counter

Uses objects/Sets to "collect" values/count frequencies of values.

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings.

(Uses [[id:53801e3f-a731-4664-9583-2aec6a207a1f][ForOfLoop]])

```js
const same = (arr1: number[], arr2: number[]) => {
  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) return false;

  let squaredHashMap = {};

  for (val of arr1) {
      const square = val * val;
    squaredHashMap[square] = (frequency1[val] || 0) + 1;
  }

  // At this point we've built up:
  // key is the square
  // The value, is the frequency (Amount of appearances)
  // 1: 1, 4: 1, 9: 1, 16: 1;

    // After we are finished looping through our second arr (arr2), our `squaredHashMap` should have these values:
  // { 1: 0, 4: 0, 9: 0, 16: 0 } Ensuring exact frequency match.
    for(val of arr2){
        if (!squaredHashMap[val]) return false;
        squaredHashMap[val] = squaredHashMap - 1;
   }
    // If we finish iterating through the secondArr without returning false,
    // that means that our arr1 contains all values that are in a squared state in arr2.
    // Therefore, we return true outside of for of loop.
    return true
}

same([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 1, 9, 16])
