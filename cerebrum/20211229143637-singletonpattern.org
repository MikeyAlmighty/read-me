#+title: SingletonPattern

The Singleton Pattern limits the number of *instances* of a particular object to just one.

This single instance is called the *singleton*.


(People argue to steer clear from using singleton: generally we try and avoid globals, globally accessible values changed anywhere (Mutibility).

Sucks for testing as well: need to mock different *instances*.

"One man's constant is another man's variable."
