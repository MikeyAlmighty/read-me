#+title: Codebase

`CodeBase`: Information that tells the *receiver* of Object where the implementation of this object can be found.

Any program that thinks it might ever pass an object to another program that may not have seen it before must set the `codebase`,
so that the *receiver* can know where to download the code from, if it doesn't have the code available locally.
The receiver will, upon deserializing ([[id:04122bab-c641-46fc-a198-95b0db7921b4][Serialization VS Marshalling]]) the object, fetch the codebase from it and load the code from that location.
