#+title: React Native Bridge

Bridge between JavaScript and Native (Android/IOS) platforms.

Allows for (Mostly) Asynchronous 2-way communication between JS and Native platforms.

Old architecture: React -> JavaScript (JSC) -> Bridge (Shadow Tree, JSON Async, Native Modules) => Native platform.

Key aspects of this (^) architecture: The JavaScript and Native realms are not aware of each orther.
This means to communicate, they rely on Async JSON messages transmitted across the Bridge.

* Limitation:
    These Async JSON messages are sent to the Native realm with the *expectation* (but NOT a guarantee) that they will get back a response.
Because of the async nature: Can *NOT* Synchronously update UI from JS
Layout must be computed on the shadow thread.
