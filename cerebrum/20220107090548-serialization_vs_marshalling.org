#+title: Serialization VS Marshalling

([[id:03657877-52b3-4507-a91a-570292386ecd][JSON Marshal/Unmarshal]])
Both do one thing in common - that is `serializing` an Object.

`Serialization` is used to *transfer* objects or to *store* them. But:

Serialization: copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte stream.

Marshalling: Passing Object to remote objects(RMI).
In Marshalling, Object is serialized(member data is serialized) + [[id:fe97eeac-08d4-4f9a-8d30-10c903fc28cd][Codebase]] is attached.

So Serialization is part of Marshalling.
