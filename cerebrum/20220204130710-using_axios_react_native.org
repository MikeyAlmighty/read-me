"The built-in fetch API might suffice if you only want to retrieve a resource from the server.
Axios may be a better option for more complex networking requirements because it comes with additional features, such as the interception of network requests and responses."

"Additionally, among other reasons, most developers prefer `Axios` over the built-in `fetch` API because of its *isomorphic* nature and *out-of-the-box JSON transformation.*"
